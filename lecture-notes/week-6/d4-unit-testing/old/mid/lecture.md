# WHY DO WE TEST?
















1. To make sure everything works

2. To increase flexibility and reduce fear

3. Make collaboration easier

4. Produce documentation



# WHAT ARE THE THREE CATEGORIES OF TESTING ON THE TESTING PYRAMID?















1. Unit Tests

2. Integration Tests

3. End-to-End (E2E) Tests



# WHAT IS THE TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT PROCESS?




























What is TDD
1. determine what code should do
2. write tests for that behavior
3. write actual code

TDD Motivations
1. Writing tests before code ensures that the code written will work
2. Only required code is written
3. Helps enforce code modularity
4. Enforces better understanding of what thee code  should be doing


TDD Process - "Red, Green, Refactor"
1. Red: write tests and watch them fail
2. Green: write minimum amt of code to ensure tests pass
3. Refactor: refactor code you just wrote so its easy to maintain and read
